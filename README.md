# Elections
Based on a video from Infinite Series called Voting systems and the Condorcet Paradox

Demonstrates the differences between multiple approaches to trying to determine the
winner of an election when the ballots are ranked preferences.

compile with make

run resulting files with ./GenerateNames and ./Counts

Modifying the value of BALLOT_SIZE will change the number of candidates available for selection
Modifying the value of and NUM_VOTERS will change the number of ballots that are cast

Currently are two separate programs, but once I get Counts completed, 
I'm going to integrate GenerateNames to create names for the candidates.
